# Deflectors
You are given a rectangular grid of arbitrary size that contains an target object at a fixed location. Your goal is to fire a laser beam into the grid to hit that target. However, the grid also contains 45-degree deflectors that alter the path of the laser beam. You need to write a program that can read such a grid and determine if it is possible to hit the target.
