# Word-Search

Write a program that solves a word-search

## Input

Your application should accept a single command-line argument that will be the name of a text file. The file will look like this:

```
5 6
AJKLDJ
KDKDAA
OROTIP
LJOKET
UIBWNW
PAL
BOOK
JOKE
```

The first row is contains two integers: `rows` and `columns`. The search-grid comes next. Finally the list of words to be sought are listed one per line.

## Output

Your program should output to the console the entire search grid with the words highlighted a different color (say yellow).
